# Everyqualia

Aggregating psychedelic experiences for semantic analysis and natural language understanding, serving as the defacto search engine for trip reports. Minimum viable product available on EveryQualia.org (currently ~10K trip reports from Erowid)

Transcendent experiences characterized by non-ordinary states of consciousness have been shown to treat depression, PTSD, anxiety, and smoking addition, offering tremendous benefit not just in the clinical setting but also for the expansion of consciousness for “well people”. There exists a knowledge gap between the observed effects of these experiences and a scientifically rigorous understanding of the mechanisms underlying the subjective quality of experience. Recent work done at Johns Hopkins, Berkeley, Imperial and Oxford have used surveys and micro-phenomenology reports to systematically study these experiences, identifying key traits such as unity, ego dissolution, ineffability, and noetic quality. While language cannot fully capture the visceral, subjective nature of these incredibly powerful experiences (how do you describe red to someone who hasn’t experienced it before?), language serves as an effective proxy to semantically cluster these experiences into different “categories”, and provides researchers in psychology, neuroscience, and natural language processing the opportunity to begin to decode these powerful, and often positively transformative experiences.

Everyqualia is a project of IPNLabs, an innovation lab of the Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network (IPN). Please feel free to direct any questions, ideas, and suggestions to `ipnpsychedelics@gmail.com`
